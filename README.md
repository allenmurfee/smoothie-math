## Project Description

Smoothie Math is an application that uses NutritionIX API's food database to provide accurate nutrition data for each ingredient you want to add to your smoothie. The motivation behind building this project was a desire to create a practical tool that allows you to find out key nutritional facts about the smoothie you're drinking. Sometimes it's tough to know all the nutritional values of all the fruits you mix in your smoothie, but with Smoothie Math, that problem is solved.

Throughout this project, we learned a lot about JavaScript, accessing data from APIs and using it properly, using the Bulma CSS framework, and more.
